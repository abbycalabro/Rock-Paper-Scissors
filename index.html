			<p>
				Redis, short for "REmote DIctionary Server", is an open source data structure server
				and key-value store. Compatible with several types of data structures and over 30 <a href="http://redis.io/clients">programming languages</a>, keys can map to a variety of data types 
				such as strings, sets, lists, and hashes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Setting it apart from many other key-value databases is the fact that Redisâ€™ dataset is held in memory rather than on disk,
				resulting in a higher performance speed but limited possible dataset size. 					
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to achieve persistence, Redis' default behavior is to sync the dataset to disk a minimum of once every two seconds.
				Alternatively, commands may be appended to a log, or persistence is able to be disabled completely.
			<p>
		</div>
		<div id="install">
			<h2>Download and Install</h2>
			<p>Visit http://redis.io/download for the newest version of Redis.</p>
			<p>
				Redis is recommended for use with OS X and Linux operating systems, with Linux being the preffered OS.

				To install Redis (the most recent version is 3.0 as of 5/24/15), run the following commands
				from your terminal:
			</p>
			<p>
				<pre>
					<code class='bash'>
	$ <b>wget</b> http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-3.0.1.tar.gz
	$ <b>tar</b> xzf redis-3.0.1.tar.gz
	$ <b>cd</b> redis-3.0.1
	$ <b>make</b>			</code>
				</pre>
				Now you can start running Redis by calling the first command, and use the built-in client by starting a new tab
				to run the second command: 
				<pre>
					<code class='bash'>
	$ src/redis-server
	$ src/redis-cli
					</code>
				</pre>
			</p>
		
		</div>
		<div id="description">
			<h2 class='page-header'>Basic Commands and Uses</h2>
			<p>
				<h3>More on Keys:</h3>
				When choosing a key, Redis <a href="http://redis.io/topics/data-types-intro#an-introduction-to-redis-data-types-and-abstractions">documentation</a>
				recommends users be conscious when deciding on the key lenght. A key that is too short is less readable in use, and a key 
				that is too long will cause excessive key-comparisons and be wasteful of memory (maximum size for a key or value is 512 MB).
				Note: any binary sequence may be used as a key, including files and empty strings.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Working with Data Structures:</h3>
				Unlike other key-value stores that only allow keys to map to strings, Redis supports the following 7 data structures:  
				<ul>
					<li>Strings and Bitmaps</li>
					<li>Sets and Sorted Sets</li>
					<li>Lists</li>
					<li>Hashes</li>
					<li>HyperLogLogs</li>
				</ul> 
				Read on for some basic examples of using Redis with these structures. For a complete list of commands available, please visit <a href="http://redis.io/commands">here</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Example 1: Strings</h3>
				Strings are considered the fundamental values of Redis. The most basic operations, the SET and GET commands, are used to create or replace a value for a string and retrieve that value, respectively. The EXISTS command will return 1 if the specified key exists in the database, or 0 if it
				does not exist. Use the DEL command to remove a key and its value. Below is a basic use of these commands:
				<pre>
					<code class='bash'>
127.0.0.1:6379> set beverage margarita
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> get beverage
"margarita"
127.0.0.1:6379> exists beverage
(integer) 1
127.0.0.1:6379> exists dessert
(integer) 0
127.0.0.1:6379> set beverage coffee
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> get beverage
"coffee"
127.0.0.1:6379> del beverage
(integer) 1
127.0.0.1:6379> exists beverage
(integer) 0
					</code>
				</pre>
			Additional commands commonly used with strings are GETSET, which assigns a new value to a string and returns the previous
			value, APPEND, SETEX to set a value and an expiration, and SETNX, which only sets a key value if the key does not yet exist.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Example 2: Integers and Atomic Incrementing</h3>
				One feature that Redis offers is atomic operations, which ensure that only one operation can be performed on a
				variable at one time, protecting against race conditions. The simplest execution of one of these operations is by
				using the INCR command. When INCR is called on a value, Redis parses it as an integer. The value is then incremented by one
				and the key is assigned the new incremented value. The command DECR is similarly atomic and decrements a value by one, and 
				INCRBY and DECRBY can be used to increment or decrement by a specific value rather than 1.
			</p>
			<p>
				An example of INCR in action will be illustrated in the walkthrough below. More complex examples of atomic operations in 
				Redis can be found <a href="http://redis.io/topics/transactions">here</a>, in which multiple commands may be executed in
				one step in what is called a transaction.
			</p>

			<h2 class='page-header'>PROJECT WALKTHROUGH</h2>
			<p>
				<h3>Intro</h3>
				For the project portion of this How-To, we will use Redis and Python to create a simple Rock Paper Scissors game
				played on the command line. Points are awarded to the player throughout the game depending on performance. Once a 
				player completes the game, all the scores and associated player names will be printed to the screen.
			</p>	
			<p>	
				Redis will be utilized to store player usernames and passwords, continuously track players' evolving scores,
				and maintiain an accurate ranking of top scores achieved throughout all gameplay.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Installation</h3>
				First, we will need to install redis-py, which is the library needed for Python to successfully interact with Redis.
				Installing redis-py can be done by calling <code>pip install redis</code>, but in order to get the most up-to-date
				version, run the following command to clone the public repository from GitHub:
				<pre>
					<code class='bash'>
	$ git clone https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py.git
					</code>
				</pre>
				Alternatively, visit the redis-py <a href="https://kushal.fedorapeople.org/redis-py/html/user/install.html">installation page</a>
				for further information.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Create rps.py</h3>
				Now, we are ready to create the Python file for our game, here named rps.py. We import redis at the top of the file, and
				in our rock_paper_scissors function connect to the Redis server:
				<pre>
					<code class='python'>

  1 import redis
  2 import random
  3
  4 def rock_paper_scissors():
  5
  6     #Create a Redis object and connect to our Redis server
  7     r = redis.Redis('localhost')
  8
  9
 10 #Call our function
 11 rock_paper_scissors()			</code>
				</pre>
			<h3>User Authentication</h3>
			We need a way to store at least a player's username and password to make authentication possible. We could use a List data structure, but
			in this case we are going to use a Hash. Hashes in Redis map between string keys and multiple string values, and they are strongly
			recommended to represent objects such as a user.
			</p>
			<p>
			Below we prompt the user if they have played before. If so, their username is already a hash key, and we simply verify their 
			password. If not, the user is prompted to enter a new username and password and a new hash gets created with this information. 
			</p>
			<pre>
				<code class='python'>
 10     #Authenticate user
 11     welcome_prompt= raw_input("Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors! Are you a new user? (y/n)  ")
 12     welcome_prompt = welcome_prompt.upper()
 13     valid = False
 14
 15     if(welcome_prompt == "Y"):
 16         #Add new user when valid username entered
 17         while(not valid):
 18             new_username = raw_input("Choose a username: ")
 19             new_password = getpass.getpass(prompt="Choose a password: ") #hide user input
 20             #Check if username exists
 21             if(r.hexists(new_username, "password")):
 22                 print("Username already taken.")
 23             else:
 24                 valid = True
 25                 #Add hash
 26                 r.hmset(new_username, {"password": new_password, "games_played": 0})
 27                 #Add user to Sorted Set
 28                 r.zadd("player_scores", new_username, 0)
 29     elif(welcome_prompt == "N"):
 30         start_validation = True
 31
 32         while(start_validation):
 33             valid_name = False
 34             #Validate username
 35             while(not valid_name):
 36                 username = raw_input("Enter username: ")
 37                 if(not r.hexists(username, "password")):
 38                     print("Invalid username.")
 39                 else:
 40                     valid_name = True
 41
 42             #Validate password
 43             password_attempt = getpass.getpass(prompt="Enter your password: ")
 44             if(password_attempt == r.hget(username, "password")):
 45                 start_validation = False
 46             else:
 47                 print("Invalid password.")
 48
 49     else:
 50         print("Sorry, not a valid response. Bye!")
 51         exit()				
				</code>
			</pre>
			<p>
			We are also using a second data structure, a Sorted Set called player_scores, to keep an updated score associated with each player. Sorted Sets are useful 
			because of how quickly elements can be added, deleted, updated, and accessed. When a new user
			is created, their score is initialized to 0 as illustrated on line 28.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Setting up the Game</h3>
			Now that our user is authenticated and our Hashes and Sorted Set are created, we are ready to write the gameplay code. The following is Python code
			for a player to play unlimited games of Rock Paper Scissors. At this point, the basic rules of the game are applied and appropriate print statements
			are in place. Note that no points are yet awarded or displayed. We will get Redis to handle that data in a moment:
			</p>

 56     options = ["ROCK", "PAPER", "SCISSORS"]
 57     new_game = True
 58
 59     while(new_game):
 60         print("Let's play! Each game has a maximum of 3 non-tied rounds. Players receive 5 points for each tie, 10 points for each round won and 30 bonus points for every game won. \n")
 61         current_round = 1
 62         user_wins = 0
 63
 64         #3 non-tying rounds to a game
 65         while(current_round &lt= 3):
 66             comp_choice = random.choice([0, 1, 2])
 67             user_choice = int(raw_input("Enter 0 for ROCK, 1 for PAPER, or 2 for SCISSORS: "))
 68
 69             print("I threw: " + options[comp_choice])

 76                 print("You win round " + str(current_round) + "! \n")
 77                 user_wins += 1
 78                 current_round += 1
 79             else:
 80                 print("You lose round " + str(current_round) + "! \n")
 81                 current_round += 1
 82
 83             #No third round if user or comp has 2 wins
 84             if(current_round == 3 and user_wins != 1):
 85                 break

 96             print("Goodbye!")
 97             new_game = False
				</code>
			</pre>
			<p>
				<h3>Calculating and Displaying Scores </h3>
				We can now use the Sorted Set we created in Redis to track and update our player's scores. We set a variable called user_score to 0, then add points
				to it every time the player ties or gets a win. After a game ends, the user's score in player_scores is incremented by the points won in the current
				game (see lin 96).
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, on line 99 we call Redis' zrevrange function to return all key value pairs of player's names and the associated score they have accumulated.
				The keys and values are parsed to display the data so it resembles a scoreboard so users can view all players and their scores in descending order.
			</p>
				<pre>

				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				As you can see, Redis is a very useful tool that can applied to almost any project where speed and simplicity are valued, and its compatibility
				with many languages enhances its versatility.
				In this particular example, we successfully used Redis to interact with our Python code, store usernames and passwords, update and track
				user scores, and return a fast and accurate ranking starting with the top scorers. For more information on Redis and its many uses, feel free
				to browse the links below.
